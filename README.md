INTRODUCTION TO DISMATH
- terms: premise, true/false, nor,and,iff,or

- truth tables
- lots of laws to memorize

#Week 3 
- quanitifiers/ universal and disproving/proving universal statements
- A LOT of terms
- hokus modus pokus modus
- addition simplification etc etc

#Week 4
- Direct proofs, indirect, n^2 if even then bla bla is even
- vacuous and trivial proofs

#Week 5
- Biconditional Statement
- Recursive algorithms and from that, induction

#Week 6
- Continuing on Induction
- Checking pseudocode for correctness
- Hoarse Triple

#Week 7
- Algorithms
- Computers are dumb
- Pseudocodes - using plainer language to describe code
- Linear and Binary search
- 
#Week 8
- Arranging a list's elements from least to greatest
- Bubble and Insertion sort: two types that have equal complexity
- Greedy algorithm - money was used as example. Applies to converting currency or changing time
- 
#Week 9
- Big-O notation
- witnesses C and k
- Big Omega is not the same as Big O (wtf?)
- Big Theta which is just omega and o together
- List of different complexities from constant to factorial
- Cryptology
- 
#Week 10

- degree
- edge
- vertex
- circuit
- path
- euler
- hamilton
- pendant
- isomorphism
- planar
- kuratowski

#Week 11
- Half on graph and half on a new topic
- four color theorem, which coincidentally helps with the project
- trees
- oak
